## 1. Introduction to BTMM {#introduction}

Steve Mauro's Beat The Market Maker (BTMM) strategy is a comprehensive forex trading methodology that focuses on understanding and exploiting the behavior patterns of large financial institutions (market makers). The strategy is built on the premise that retail traders can achieve consistent profitability by aligning themselves with institutional flow rather than fighting against it.

### Core Philosophy

> "The market is not random. It follows predictable patterns driven by institutional necessity." - Steve Mauro

**Key Principles:**
- Market makers follow a systematic 4-phase approach to price manipulation
- Each trading session has distinct characteristics and purposes
- Retail traders are systematically trapped through false signals
- Understanding institutional behavior provides a significant edge
- Risk management is paramount to long-term success

### Historical Context

Steve Mauro developed the BTMM methodology through years of institutional trading experience and retail trader education. The strategy gained popularity in the early 2000s and has evolved to incorporate modern market dynamics while maintaining its core principles.

**Why BTMM Works:**
- Based on institutional order flow patterns
- Accounts for market maker profit motivations
- Provides clear entry and exit criteria
- Incorporates robust risk management
- Adaptable to various market conditions

## 2. The 4-Phase Market Structure {#4-phase-structure}

The foundation of BTMM strategy lies in understanding the 4-phase market structure that market makers use to extract profits from retail traders.

### Phase 1: Accumulation (Asian Session)
**Timeframe:** 21:00 - 06:00 UTC  
**Characteristics:** Low volatility, range-bound consolidation  
**Purpose:** Establish daily high/low levels and build positions

#### Key Features:
- **Range Formation:** Market makers establish the daily range during low-volume periods
- **Level Setting:** High and low of the Asian session become key levels for the day
- **Position Building:** Institutions accumulate positions at favorable prices
- **Volatility Suppression:** Deliberate reduction of volatility to create false sense of stability

#### Implementation Criteria:
```pinescript
// Asian session detection
in_asian = session.issydney or (hour >= 21 or hour < 6)

// Range tracking
var float asian_high = na
var float asian_low = na

if session_start
    asian_high := high
    asian_low := low
else if in_asian
    asian_high := math.max(asian_high, high)
    asian_low := math.min(asian_low, low)
