# TradingView Pine Script Indicator Builder - Continuous PRD

## 🚨 CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

### 🔒 **MANDATORY RULE: Automated Commit Process Final Step**
**Priority: P0 - CRITICAL**

Every development workflow, automation script, and system process MUST end with automated commit sequence:

```yaml
Required Automation Pattern:

  2. Validate changes and quality checks
  3. MANDATORY: npm run git-commit
  4. MANDATORY: npm run git-push  
  5. MANDATORY: npm run git-status (verify clean)
```

**Enforcement Mechanisms:**
- ✅ All package.json scripts ending with automated commits
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines must include commit steps
- ✅ Cursor rules must reference this requirement
