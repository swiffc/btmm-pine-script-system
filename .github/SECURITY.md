## 🛡️ **Security Standards**

### Code Security Requirements
```yaml
BTMM Security Standards:
  - No hardcoded credentials or API keys
  - Input validation for all user parameters
  - Secure handling of trading data
  - Protection against injection attacks
  - Safe file handling in automation scripts
  - Secure GitHub token management
```

### Pine Script Security
```pinescript
// ✅ Good: Use input parameters
leverage = input.float(1.0, "Leverage", minval=0.1, maxval=5.0)

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded sensitive values
// leverage = 2.5  // Never hardcode trading parameters
```

### Automation Security
```javascript
// ✅ Good: Environment variables
const githubToken = process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN;

// ❌ Bad: Hardcoded tokens
// const githubToken = "ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxx";
```

## 🔍 **Security Scanning**

### Automated Security Checks
We run automated security scans on every commit:

```yaml
Security Pipeline:
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning (Dependabot)
  - Secret detection (GitHub Secret Scanning)

  - Container security scanning (Trivy)
  - License compliance checking
```

### Manual Security Reviews
- **Quarterly**: Full security audit by external firm
- **Monthly**: Internal security review
- **Per Release**: Security checklist validation
- **Per Incident**: Post-incident security analysis
