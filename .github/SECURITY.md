## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the BTMM trading system seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### Where to Report
- **Email**: [Create issue with SECURITY label for non-critical issues]
- **Critical Issues**: Contact maintainers directly through private channels

### What to Include
When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact on trading operations
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Affected Components**: Which BTMM files or systems are affected
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for remediation

### Response Timeline
- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates on progress
- **Resolution**: Target within 30 days for critical issues

## Security Considerations for Trading Systems

### Pine Script Security
- **API Keys**: Never hardcode API keys or credentials in Pine Script files
- **Data Validation**: Always validate input parameters
- **Resource Limits**: Respect TradingView's resource limitations
- **Alert Security**: Use secure alert webhook endpoints

### MT4 Security
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper file access permissions
- **Input Validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Broker Integration**: Use only trusted broker APIs
- **Expert Advisor Safety**: Implement fail-safes in automated trading

### Development Security
- **Code Review**: All code changes require review
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scans
- **Access Control**: Limited access to production systems
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted backups of trading configurations

### Data Protection
- **Trading Data**: No personal trading data stored in repository
- **Configuration Files**: Sensitive configurations kept private
- **User Privacy**: No collection of personal trading information
- **Compliance**: Adherence to financial data protection standards

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Never commit** sensitive information (API keys, credentials)
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Test security fixes** thoroughly before submission
4. **Follow secure coding** practices for trading applications

### For Users
1. **Keep systems updated** with latest security patches
2. **Use strong authentication** for trading accounts
3. **Monitor trading activity** for unusual behavior
4. **Backup configurations** securely

### For Deployment
1. **Secure communication** channels for alerts
2. **Regular security audits** of trading systems
3. **Access logging** for system modifications
4. **Incident response plan** for security breaches

## Known Security Considerations

### TradingView Platform
- Pine Script runs in TradingView's sandboxed environment
- Limited access to external resources for security
- Built-in rate limiting for alert systems

### MT4 Platform
- Expert Advisors have broader system access
- Require careful validation of all inputs
- Should implement trading limits and safeguards

### Web Platform
- Uses secure authentication and session management
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Rate limiting on API endpoints

## Compliance and Standards

This project follows security best practices for:
- Financial software development
- Trading system security
- Open source security guidelines
- Data protection requirements
