# Chapter 1: Introduction to BTMM Methodology

## Overview
Welcome to the Beat The Market Makers (BTMM) methodology developed by Steve Mauro. This comprehensive approach to trading focuses on understanding institutional behavior and market maker strategies to identify high-probability trading opportunities.

## Key Concepts

### What is BTMM?
BTMM stands for "Beat The Market Makers" - a methodology that teaches traders to think like institutional players and identify when retail traders are being manipulated.

### Core Principles
1. **Market Makers Control Price Movement**: Understand that major financial institutions and market makers drive price action
2. **Retail Sentiment is Often Wrong**: When retail traders are overly bullish or bearish, institutions often move price in the opposite direction
3. **Structure Before Direction**: Focus on market structure and confluence before determining directional bias
4. **Time and Session Awareness**: Different trading sessions have different characteristics and opportunities

### The Three Market Maker Phases
1. **Accumulation**: Market makers build positions quietly
2. **Manipulation**: Price moves to trigger retail stops and create liquidity
3. **Distribution**: Market makers close positions as retail traders enter
