# Chapter 2: EMA Food System Deep Dive

## The Foundation of BTMM Analysis

Steve Mauro's EMA Food System is the cornerstone of BTMM technical analysis. This unique approach uses five EMAs with specific colors and characteristics to determine market bias and trend strength.

## The Five EMAs

### 1. 5 EMA - "Mustard" ðŸŸ¨
- **Purpose**: Fast momentum and immediate price reaction
- **Color**: Yellow (like mustard)
- **Usage**: Entry timing and short-term bias

### 2. 13 EMA - "Ketchup" ðŸŸ¥
- **Purpose**: Critical confirmation line
- **Color**: Red (like ketchup)
- **Usage**: Most important EMA for bias confirmation

### 3. 50 EMA - "Water" ðŸŸ¦
- **Purpose**: Intraday trend reference
- **Color**: Blue (like water)
- **Usage**: Support/resistance on lower timeframes

### 4. 200 EMA - "Mayo" ðŸŸ©
- **Purpose**: Long-term trend direction
- **Color**: Green (like mayo... Steve's choice!)
- **Usage**: Major trend bias on all timeframes

### 5. 800 EMA - "Blueberry" ðŸŸª
- **Purpose**: Higher timeframe bias
- **Color**: Purple (like blueberries)
- **Usage**: Weekly/monthly trend direction

## Stack Analysis

### Perfect Bull Stack
When all EMAs are aligned with price above all EMAs:
```
Price > 5 EMA > 13 EMA > 50 EMA > 200 EMA > 800 EMA
```

### Perfect Bear Stack
When all EMAs are aligned with price below all EMAs:
```
Price < 5 EMA < 13 EMA < 50 EMA < 200 EMA < 800 EMA
```

### Mixed Stack
When EMAs are not perfectly aligned - requires careful analysis of which EMAs are acting as support/resistance.

## 8-Point Bias System

Calculate bias strength by scoring each condition:
- Price vs 5 EMA: +1 if above, 0 if below
- Price vs 13 EMA: +1 if above, 0 if below  
- Price vs 50 EMA: +1 if above, 0 if below
- Price vs 200 EMA: +1 if above, 0 if below
- Price vs 800 EMA: +1 if above, 0 if below
- Perfect Stack Bonus: +3 points

**Total Score Interpretation:**
- 6-8 points: Strong Bullish Bias
- 3-5 points: Neutral/Mixed
- 0-2 points: Strong Bearish Bias

## Practical Application

### Entry Signals
- **Long entries**: Look for price pullbacks to key EMAs in a bull stack
- **Short entries**: Look for price rejections from key EMAs in a bear stack

### Exit Signals
- Stack breakdown (EMAs starting to cross)
- Price breaking through critical EMAs (especially 13 and 50)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. Ignoring the 800 EMA for higher timeframe bias
2. Trading against a perfect stack
3. Not waiting for EMA confluence
4. Overlooking mixed stack scenarios
